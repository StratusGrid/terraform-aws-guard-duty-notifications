  GitHub: [StratusGrid/terraform-aws-lambda-pipeline](https://github.com/StratusGrid/terraform-aws-lambda-pipeline)
  ## Example
  ```hcl
  {{ include "examples/example1.tfnot" }}
  ```
  
  ## StratusGrid Standards we assume
  - All resource names and name tags shall use `_` and not `-`s
  - The old naming standard for common files such as inputs, outputs, providers, etc was to prefix them with a `-`, this is no longer true as it's not POSIX compliant. Our pre-commit hooks will fail with this old standard.
  - StratusGrid generally follows the TerraForm standards outlined [here](https://www.terraform-best-practices.com/naming)
